# TicTacToe-Game
Simple game built with JavaFX

This Simple Game was built using Java SE 8u192 (JDK 1.8.0_192).

The Game.java file is the "main file" that the JAR is built from so it is this file that needs to be ran to play the game.

This Game was made after recently learning how to code in Java so any poor code structure is acceptable :)
